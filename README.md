# Net Run Rate Calculator

## About

This is a cricket net run rate (NRR) calculator made in Python.

## Formula

> The formula for calculating the NRR for any team is as following: 
> Net Run Rate = (Total Runs Scored ÷ Total Overs Faced) – (Total Runs Conceded ÷ Total Overs Bowled)

>Where:

>- “Total Runs Scored” is the number of runs scored by the team (it is also the number of runs conceded by the opposing team).
>- “Total Overs Faced” is the number of overs faced by the team (it is also the number of overs bowled by the opposing team).
>- “Total Runs Conceded” is the number of runs conceded by the team (it is also the number of runs scored by the opposing team).
>- “Total Overs Bowled” is the number of overs bowled by the team (it is also the number of overs faced by the opposing team).
>- Net Run Rate can be calculated for a match or a tournament.

## Implementation

Run `python3 net_run_rate_calc.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
